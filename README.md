2. If you add this to git, remember to remove `.git` folder with `rm -rf .git`
3. `npm-check-updates -u` to update Node.JS modules (you need [npm-check-updates](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check-updates) for this)
4. `npm install` to install them
5. `npm update` to update them
6. Edit `package.json` and `gulpfile.js` and rename project name and author according to your new project
